===================

## Updating the Perk Tutor Pages:

### If you publish a paper which uses Perk Tutor:

Please add the reference to the publications list and add it to the examples page. If there is previous work on the application, add it to the already existing example page and update the text and image. If there is no previous work on the application, create a new example with text and a image, and link to it from the "Examples" page.

### If you have made a significant update to Perk Tutor:

Please add a small description of it in the recent updates section. This only requires modifying the "index.md" file.

### If you use Perk Tutor in an Outreach event:

Please add the event to the log of outreach events on the "Outreach" page.

## Additional Notes:

### If you are adding content only:

Please only modify the ".md" files. No content should appear in any of the ".html" files.

### If you are adding a new example:

Please create a new page for the example (in the root directory), add a new image (in the images subfolder), and link to the new page from the "Examples" page. Please ensure the image is the same size as the other example images (600x400) for consistency.
