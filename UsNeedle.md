# Training for Ultrasound-Guided Needle Insertion Using 3D Visualization

The open-source Perk Tutor training platform has been shown to improve trainee performance in interventions that require ultrasound guidance. Our goal was to determine if needle coordination of medical trainees can be improved by training with Perk Tutor compared to training with ultrasound only.

Twenty participants with no previous experience were randomized into two groups; the Perk Tutor group and the Control group. The Perk Tutor group had access to the 3D visualization while the Control group used ultrasound only during their training. Performance was analyzed, measured and compared by Perk Tutor with regards to four needle coordination metrics. None of the groups had access to 3D visualization during performance testing.

The needle tracking measurements showed, for the Perk Tutor group, lower average distance between the needle tip and ultrasound (1.2 [0.9 – 2.8] mm vs 2.7 [2.3 – 4.0] mm, respectively; P = 0.023) and lower maximum distance between the needle tip and ultrasound (2.2 [1.9 – 3.2] mm vs 4.6 [3.9 – 6.2] mm, respectively; P = 0.013). There was no significant difference in average needle to ultrasound plane angle and maximum needle to ultrasound plane distance. All participants were successful in the procedure.

The Perk Tutor group had significantly reduced distance from the needle tip to the ultrasound plane. Training with Perk Tutor can improve trainees’ needle and ultrasound coordination.
