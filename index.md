# PerkTutor Recent Updates


### January 15, 2015

Transform and anatomy roles have been added to the PerkTutor. This allows users to define metrics which are specific to anatomy, such as tissue or target points, and specific to tools, such as needles or ultrasound probes.


### December 11, 2013

User-configurable metrics have been added to the PerkTutor. This allows users to define their own evaluation metrics using Python scripts. See [User-Configurable Metrics](https://github.com/PerkTutor/PerkEvaluator/wiki/User-Configurable-Metrics) for details.
