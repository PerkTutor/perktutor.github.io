# Holographically Augmented Training for Suturing

A training module for basic suturing training called Suture Tutor was developed by combining video instruction and voice commands with the Microsoft HoloLens software. We put forth two hypotheses: Trainees find the HoloLens helpful and 2.) HoloLens helps the trainees to achieve a better score in objective skill assessment tests.

Software module was developed to show instructional video in the HoloLens under voice command. Thirty-two participants were split into the control group or the HoloLens group. The control group used videos displayed on a computer during training while the HoloLens group practiced with Suture Tutor. Each group was given seven minutes to train with their assigned training method before testing. Testing involved replication of a running locking suturing pattern with a time limit of five minutes and was video recorded. The videos were expert reviewed. Participants in the HoloLens group filled out a usability survey.

The trainees found the Hololens to be usable and realistic, and the HoloLens group used the instructional videos more than the control group did (p = 0.0175). There was no difference in the skill assessment test scores between the HoloLens and the control group and their rates of completion in the allotted time was similar.

Participants found the Suture Tutor to be a user friendly and helpful adjunct. The study was unable to determine if the Suture Tutor helps trainees in achieving a better score in skill assessment testing.
